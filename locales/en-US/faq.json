                "a": "ICHI Rating is a hero evaluation index that measures how frequently each hero is played among the top 500 players on the competitive leaderboard. It reflects the most-played heroes of Challenger-tier players in each region."

                "q": "How is ICHI Rating calculated?",
                "a": "The system crawls the Top 500 leaderboard and checks each player's three most-played heroes. The 1st most-played hero receives 3 points, the 2nd receives 2 points, and the 3rd receives 1 point. These scores are summed across all Top 500 players in each region to produce the final ICHI Rating."

                "q": "When is the data updated?",
                "a": "ICHI Rating data is collected and updated daily. Each data point on the chart represents one day's snapshot of the Top 500 leaderboard."
            },
            {
                "q": "How should I interpret the chart?",
                "a": "A higher ICHI Rating means the hero is played more frequently by Challenger-tier players. Sudden spikes often correspond to balance patches or meta shifts. Comparing heroes across regions reveals how the meta differs between Asia, Europe, and the Americas."
